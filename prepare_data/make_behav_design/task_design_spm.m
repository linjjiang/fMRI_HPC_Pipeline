% Version 4 - Creating SPM Task Design Files

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE PROCEEDING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If you use fMRIprep to perform slice-timing correction, you have to
% double-check the microtime onset in your SPM GLM model. The rationale is
% that fMRIprep performs STC using the AFNIÂ 3dTshift function, which uses
% the middle slice as the reference. So you need to make sure that in the
% SPM GLM, the reference slice is the middle slice too. Otherwise, you need
% to deliberately adjust the onset of the events by -TR/2.

% More discussions:
% https://reproducibility.stanford.edu/slice-timing-correction-in-fmriprep-and-linear-modeling/
% https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/outputs.html#outputs-of-fmriprep 

% In this version of the script, I did not shift the event onset for SPM
% design matrix as it will be fed into the SPM GLM analysis directly. So
% make sure you double-check the microtime resolution in your model!!!!
