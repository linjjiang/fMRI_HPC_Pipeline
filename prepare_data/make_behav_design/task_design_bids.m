% Task Design Extraction - to create BIDS-compatible TSV files

% Version 3 - Creating BIDS-COMPATIBLE TSV files with -half_TR shift on EVENT onsets

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE PROCEEDING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If you use fMRIprep to perform slice-timing correction, you have to
% shift the event onset by -TR/2 in your model. The rationale is
% that fMRIprep performs STC using the AFNIÂ 3dTshift function, which uses
% the middle slice as the reference. 

% More discussions:
% https://reproducibility.stanford.edu/slice-timing-correction-in-fmriprep-and-linear-modeling/
% https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/outputs.html#outputs-of-fmriprep 

% In this version of the script, I shifted the event onset by -TR/2 as it 
% will be used for customized causal connectivity analysis. 

% And I further removed 3.2 s at the very beginning as dummy scans during the hcp_upmc_task_design.m scripts
% (which matched what I did during fMRIPrep preprocessing.
